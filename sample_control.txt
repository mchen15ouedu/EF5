# Lake Module Features:
# 1. Storage-based overflow when storage > th_volume
# 2. Linear reservoir outflow when storage <= th_volume
# 3. Engineered discharge override when DamQ file is provided
# 4. Per-lake calibration of klake parameter
# 5. Water balance including precipitation and evaporation
# 6. State saving/loading for lake storage and outflow
# 7. Grid-based state management for distributed simulations
# 8. Full integration with EF5's DREAM calibration system

# Configuration Notes:
# - All key names are case insensitive (except section names and file paths)
# - Lake CSV reading supports both lakes_csv and lakelistfile keys
# - Engineered discharge supports engineered_discharge_csv, lakeoutflowfile, and DamQ keys
# - Lake calibration uses lakecaliparams section (generated from Models.tbl)
# - Lake parameters are defined in the lakes.csv file (klake column)
